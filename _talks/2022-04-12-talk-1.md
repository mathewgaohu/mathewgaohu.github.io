Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been used to quantify uncertainties in seismic full-waveform inverse problems.
However, MCMC is usually prohibitive for such problems, due to the large number of samples required. 
The generalized preconditioned Crankâ€“Nicolson method uses proposals with covariance operators based on the (Gauss-Newton) Hessian of the negative log likelihood at the MAP point to accelerate the sampling process. 
Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large scale problems. Moreover, slow decay of its eigenvalues means that low-rank approximation is not effective.
We propose a Hessian approximation method based on a local translation invariance approximation.  
This is achieved through a product-convolution scheme followed by a low-rank correction.
The approximation can be expressed in the form of an H-matrix, which facilitates fast matrix computations needed for drawing samples. The results show that the approximation speeds up MCMC significantly compared to low-rank approximation.
