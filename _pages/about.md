I am a Ph.D. candidate at Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences. My research invovles approximation methods for high-rank Hessians in seismic inverse problems, and the applications of these approximations in in uncertainty quantification. 

Research Interest
======
1. Applications: (1) Seismic imaging.
2. Methods: (1) Large scale Bayesian inference; (2) Numerical Optimization; (3) Hessian approximation in PDE constrained inverse problems.
