I am a Ph.D. candidate at Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences. My research involves approximation methods for high-rank Hessians in seismic inverse problems, and the applications of these approximations in uncertainty quantification. 

Research Interest
======
1. Applications: (1) Seismic imaging.
2. Methods: (1) Large-scale Bayesian inference; (2) Numerical Optimization; (3) Hessian approximation in PDE-constrained inverse problems.

Education
======
* B.S., Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, 2017
* M.S., Mathematics, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, New York, 2019 (Antoine Cerfon, advisor)
* Ph.D., Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM), Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 2025 (Omar Ghattas, advisor) (expected)
