I am Mathew Hu, a Ph.D. Candidate in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin (Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences). My research focuses on developing advanced optimization, preconditioning, and uncertainty quantification techniques for seismic imaging and large-scale inverse problems. With expertise in numerical analysis, high-performance computing, and machine learning, I aim to create efficient, scalable solutions that bridge computational theory and industry applications.

# Research Interests

- Optimization & uncertainty quantification in large-scale inverse problems
- Machine learning applications in scientific computing
- High-performance computing for simulation and modeling

# Education

- B.S., Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, 2017
- M.S., Mathematics, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciencess, New York University, New York, New York, 2019 (Antoine Cerfon, advisor; Georg Stadler, co-advisor)
- Ph.D., Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM), Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas (Omar Ghattas, advisor; Rami Nammour, co-advisor) (expected Aug. 2025)
